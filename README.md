# Discrypt
### A discord plugin + backend that allows for full encrypted discord messages with as non-intrusive design as possible

## Goals
- encryption key exchange completely independent of discord servers (otherwise what's the point, right?)
- no centralized or dependent servers
- handle servers and direct messages
- no disturbing vpn connections
